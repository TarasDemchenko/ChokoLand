            Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of
            mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals
            (breastfed human infants too) before they are able to digest solid
            food.

            Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies
            that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many
            diseases. Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and
            lactose.
